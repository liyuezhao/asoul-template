# An A-SOUL LaTeX template

This repository consists of some source codes of a handout, prepared for 
a talk on index theory. I make it open source as I was asked to share a
copy of the LaTeX template used there.

Honestly speaking, I did not manage to write a template, but rather
design a few theorem-like environments using the package mdframed. 
These codes were available in asoul.sty. 
The pictures used there (see ./img) are of a Chinese virtual idol group
called **A-SOUL**. I used to be a crazy fan of it in 2021.

My early plan was to implement this into a true template. That is why I
used the package kvoptions in that sty file. Unfortunately, my passion
faded away for various unpleasant reasons. 
And this is what it looks like now.

Please feel free to use or modify these documents as you like.
