# An A-SOUL LaTeX template

This repository consists of the LaTeX source codes of the handout of a talk
of mine given in 2021. It gets open-sourced because I am asked to share a
copy of the LaTeX template that I was using.

Precisely speaking, I did not manage to write a template, but rather
designed a few theorem-like environments. These codes were available in
asoul.sty. The pictures used there are from a Chinese virtual idol group
called **A-SOUL**, of which I was a fan during the year 2021-2022.

My early plan was to implement this into a true template. That is why I
used the package kvoptions in that sty file. Unfortunately, my passion
faded away for various reasons. And this is what it looks like at the
moment.

Feel free to use or modify these documents.
